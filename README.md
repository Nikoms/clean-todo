# Yet another todo list in react

This time, i'll make a todo list... But a todo list with clean architecture principle. Step by step, feature by feature, merge request by merge request, I'll make it functional and clean :)


- If you have an idea of a feature or a question, use the [issue](https://github.com/Nikoms/clean-todo/issues) tab
- If you want to see the priorities of this biiiig project, use the [project](https://github.com/Nikoms/clean-todo/projects/1) tab
- Conclusion of "problems" or choices will be explained on [my blog](https://www.mechantblog.com)
- The final result is available [here](https://naughty-banach-1ccbd2.netlify.app/)



## Other remarks

- I don't want to have a "css framework" to style the application. They really mess up the final code and I want to show you "pure" HTML code... And It's also dependencies that I haven't to update or "understand".
- First commits may not be "clean", but it will allow me to put an understandable base for all frontend develpers
- This project will be done in React because it's the last I used, not because it's my favorite :)
